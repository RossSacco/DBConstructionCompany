# DBConstructionCompany
Project for the "Databases" course, Computer Engineering, University of  Pisa 🗿  

Collaboratively developed with Tommaso Falaschi 👯‍♂️

## Description
The project wants to develop a database dedicated to a generic construction company.  
This DB is a comprehensive system designed to address the multifaceted needs of a modern construction enterprise.  
Built on the principles of relational database design, it ensures data integrity, coherence, and scalability, catering to the dynamic nature of the construction industry.  

## Key Features
- **Project Management** : Stores detailed information about each construction project, including its timeline, budget and resources.

- **Inventory Control** : Monitors the quantity and location of construction materials, tools, and machinery, optimizing procurement and usage.

- **Human Resources** : Manages employee data, including roles, qualifications, work assignments, and payroll information.

- **Geological Hazard and Calamity Monitoring**: Offers tools for the assessment, monitoring, and recording of potential geological dangers and calamities that may impact construction sites, ensuring enhanced safety and risk management measures.

## Analytics Tools
In addition to a suite of pre-built operations designed to efficiently query the database for essential information, our system has incorporated advanced data analytics modules. Two such specialized analytics focus predominantly on the maintainability of constructed buildings.  

These analytics provide a comprehensive insight into the long-term sustainability and performance of structures. By analyzing patterns, wear and tear, and other key indicators, they offer predictive maintenance schedules to proactively address potential issues.

Furthermore, in relation to identified risks, these analytics also suggest recommended interventions. This ensures that not only are buildings maintained at their optimum levels, but any potential threats are addressed in a timely and efficient manner, greatly enhancing the longevity and safety of the constructions.
